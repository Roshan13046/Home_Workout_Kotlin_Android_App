## Project Learnings  📦
I have learned a bunch of very fundamental features of Android\

● I learned to setup UI, to get rid of the action bar, to add screen intents, and to customize the toolbar.\
● I learned to implement Custom UI elements for the progress bar to tick counter clock.\
● Adding the Model and Constants for the exercises and testing it.\
● Learned to include Text to speech feature, adding a media player to play a sound once the exercise is over.\
● Creating a finish activity. Setting up the CustomDialog for the back button.\
● I also learned to add Custom RadioGroups with RadioButtons.\
● Learned the difference between View Gone and View Invisible.\
● Brief learning to use SQLite about using Primary key, to create a table and Datatypes, CRUD operations and working of database tables, adding    SqliteOpenHelper and storing Data permanently in Database, Reading the Database entries and preparing the ListView Layout.\
● To prepare recycler view for the bottom to display exercise number, and to create custom recycler view adapter and View Holder.
